# AI-Powered Scheduling Assistant - Project Description

## Executive Summary

The AI-Powered Scheduling Assistant is a revolutionary meeting coordination system that leverages Agentic AI to automate the complex process of scheduling meetings across multiple participants, time zones, and priority levels. Built on LangGraph framework with Google Calendar integration, this system eliminates the traditional back-and-forth communication required for meeting scheduling while implementing intelligent conflict resolution based on business priorities.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Meeting Scheduling

1. **Manual Coordination Overhead**
   - Multiple email exchanges to find suitable time slots
   - Time-consuming back-and-forth communication
   - Difficulty coordinating across different time zones
   - Inefficient handling of meeting conflicts

2. **Lack of Priority Awareness**
   - No intelligent distinction between meeting types
   - Inability to automatically resolve conflicts based on business importance
   - Manual intervention required for urgent meetings

3. **Limited Automation**
   - Existing tools lack intelligent decision-making capabilities
   - No automatic conflict detection and resolution
   - Requires human oversight for complex scheduling scenarios

## Solution Overview

- **Structured Output**: Pydantic models ensure consistent responses
- **Multi-step Reasoning**: Complex decision-making capabilities

#### Language Model Integration
- **Model**: Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct
- **Deployment**: Local vLLM inference server
- **Performance**: Sub-second response times
- **Scalability**: Handles multiple concurrent requests

### 2. Calendar Integration Layer

#### Google Calendar API

- **Timezone Handling**: Automatic IST timezone conversions
- **Buffer Management**: 2-hour conflict prevention buffers

### 3. Priority Management System

#### Meeting Classification Engine
```
P0 - OUTAGE MEETINGS (CRITICAL)
├── Keywords: emergency, urgent, ASAP, outage, crash, failure, breach, crisis, critical
├── Rules: Override ALL conflicts, schedule immediately
└── Behavior: Can override weekends, off-hours, all meetings

P1 - CLIENT/CUSTOMER MEETINGS (HIGH)
├── Keywords: client, customer, demo, feedback, requirements, quarterly review
├── Rules: Override internal meetings only, business hours
└── Behavior: Cannot override outages or external events

P2 - INTERNAL MEETINGS (STANDARD)
├── Keywords: team, 1-on-1, sprint, project, catchup, planning, retrospective
├── Rules: Can be rescheduled for higher priority meetings
└── Behavior: Business hours only, flexible scheduling
```

#### Priority Resolution Matrix
| Request Type | vs Outage | vs Client | vs Internal | vs Leave/External |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Outage**   | Override  | Override  | Override    | Override          |
| **Client**   | Defer     | Defer     | Override    | Defer             |
| **Internal** | Defer     | Defer     | Defer       | Defer             |

### 4. Conflict Resolution Engine

#### Intelligent Conflict Detection
- **Overlap Analysis**: Identifies time conflicts between meetings
- **Priority Assessment**: Evaluates relative importance of conflicting meetings
- **Buffer Management**: Implements 2-hour buffers to prevent scheduling conflicts
- **Multi-day Search**: Automatically finds next available slots

#### Smart Rescheduling Logic
```python
# Example conflict resolution logic
if event_start < opt_end and opt_start < event_end:
    new_start = opt_end + timedelta(hours=2)
    new_end = new_start + (event_end - event_start)
    moved_events.append({
        "StartTime": new_start,
        "EndTime": new_end,
        "NumAttendees": event["NumAttendees"],
        "Attendees": event["Attendees"],
        "Summary": event["Summary"]
    })
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. React Pattern Implementation

#### Thinking Phase
- Analyzes meeting request context
- Determines priority level (P0/P1/P2)
- Plans required actions and tool usage

#### Acting Phase
- Calls calendar API to fetch events
- Scans participant availability
- Identifies conflicts and potential solutions

#### Observing Phase
- Processes calendar data
- Evaluates conflict resolution options
- Refines strategy based on findings

#### Iterative Process
- Multiple reasoning cycles if needed
- Adapts to complex scenarios
- Ensures optimal scheduling decisions

### 2. Natural Language Processing

#### Request Parsing
- **Context Understanding**: Extracts meeting intent and requirements
- **Date/Time Extraction**: Handles explicit dates, day names, and relative references
- **Participant Identification**: Recognizes meeting attendees
- **Priority Detection**: Identifies urgency indicators

#### Example Processing
```python
email_content = "Hi, I need to schedule a client demo meeting on Monday 2025-07-21 at 9:00 AM IST."

# System extracts:
# - Meeting type: CLIENT (P1)
# - Date: 2025-07-21 (Monday)
# - Time: 9:00 AM IST
# - Priority: High (client meeting)
```

### 3. Structured Output Generation

#### Pydantic Model
```python
class Structured_Output_llm(BaseModel):
    start_time: str = Field(description="Proposed Start Time")
    end_time: str = Field(description="Proposed End Time")
    duration: int = Field(description="duration between Start time and End time")
    optimal_start_time: str = Field(description="Conflict free start date/time")
    optimal_end_time: str = Field(description="Conflict free end date/time")
```

#### JSON Output Format
```json
{
    "EventStart": "2025-07-21T09:00:00+05:30",
    "EventEnd": "2025-07-21T10:00:00+05:30",
    "Duration_mins": "60",
    "Attendees": [
        {
            "email": "userone.amd@gmail.com",
